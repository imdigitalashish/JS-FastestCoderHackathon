### Parts in which github copilot helped

Apart from UI, github copilot helps me develope features faster for common tasks such as getting 
the elements in a list and checking which is the selected index <br>

Switch back to zero index if we are the end of the list <br>

And sometimes it even predicts what I am trying to do and automatically completes the whole function
if the function name is relevant such as updateSelectedIndex(); with industry level code by adding validations and error checking, that was really amazing ðŸŽ‰ <br>
